# Burger Barn

This is a website for a fictional restaurant called Burger Barn. The site allows users to view the menu, learn more about the restaurant, and contact it's fictional email address. In creating this project, my goal was to build a simple responsive website for a small business. To achieve this goal, I used HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript.
